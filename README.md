# LGStylo5Case
A simple phone case for an LG Stylo 5 modeled in FeeCAD

## About
In the spirit of Hacktoberfest, I wanted to contribute something to the 3D modeling world.  We recently changed phone providers and picked up some new phones (an LG Stylo 5).  Instead of buying a case, I decided to contribute one to the open source community.  This case is simple, and gives a lot of room for creativity and customization.  So please feel free to take it and make something more out of it.  I modeled this in FreeCAD, and am including the FreeCAD file, as well as a STEP and STL to allow you to "re-make" it however you see fit.
